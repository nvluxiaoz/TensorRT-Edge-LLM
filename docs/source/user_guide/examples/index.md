# Examples

Choose the workflow by its input and output contract. The
[Supported Models](../getting_started/supported-models.md) page maps each model
family to these contracts.

## Text Output

- [Text generation](../getting_started/quick-start-guide.md): one shared workflow
  for dense LLM, MoE, VLM, and Omni text output; Phi-4 Multimodal adds the
  model-specific [vision-LoRA merge](phi4.md)
- [Speculative Decoding](speculative-decoding.md): MTP, EAGLE3, DFlash, DSpark,
  and JetSpec acceleration
- [ASR](asr.md): audio to transcript text with Qwen3-ASR
- [Nemotron-3.5-ASR](../../developer_guide/models/nemotron3_5_asr.md): audio to transcript text with a model-specific RNN-T runtime

## Speech Output

- [Qwen3-TTS](tts.md): text, style, language, or reference speech to 24 kHz speech
- [Qwen3-Omni](omni.md): text, images, or audio to text and optional 24 kHz speech

## Action Output

- [Vision-Language-Action](vla/index.md): Alpamayo trajectory generation and
  Cosmos3 policy action generation

## Serving and Evaluation

- [Experimental Python API and Server](experimental-server.md): Python and OpenAI-compatible interfaces
- [NeMo Evaluator](nemo-evaluator.md): evaluate a local OpenAI-compatible server
